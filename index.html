<h1>C++ Inheritance Project</h1>

<p>For an inheritance structure in C++ it is important
to remember that it is not the same as it is in java, 
where you need to have multiple classes or an IDE that
will allow you to run multiple classes from the same file.
You can easily run it from one file and should run it from 
one file. Here is an example below:</p>
<p>class animal(<br>  public:<br>int height;<br>int weight;<br>)</p>
<p>class person: public animal(<br>  public:<br>std::string first;<br>std::string last;<br>)</p>
