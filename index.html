<h1>C++ Inheritance Project</h1>

<p>For an inheritance structure in C++ it is important to remember that it is not<br>
the same as it is in java, where you need to have multiple classes or an IDE that<br>
will allow you to run multiple classes from the same file. You can easily run it<br>
from one file and should run it from one file. Here is an example below:</p>
<a>class animal(<br>
  <emsp>public:<br>
    <emsp><emsp>int height;<br>
      <emsp><emsp>int weight;<br>)</a>
<a>class person: public animal(<br>
  <emsp>public:<br>
    <emsp><emsp>std::string first;<br>
      <emsp><emsp>std::string last;<br>)</a>
