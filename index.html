<h1>C++ Inheritance Project</h1>

<p>For an inheritance structure in C++ it is important to remember that it is not<br>
the same as it is in java, where you need to have multiple classes or an IDE that<br>
will allow you to run multiple classes from the same file. You can easily run it<br>
from one file and should run it from one file. Here is an example below:</p>
<p>class animal(<br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic:<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint height;<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint weight;<br>)</p>
<p>class person: public animal(<br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic:<br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspstd::string first;<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspstd::string last;<br>)</p>
